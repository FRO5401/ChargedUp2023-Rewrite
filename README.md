# ChargedUp2023-Rewrite

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to rewrite the code for our 2023 robot, Bucky! 

## Goal
Our goal is to clean up the code, and also use this as an opportunity for newer programmers to practice coding an entire robot. :)

# This is Team 5401's repository for the 2023 FRC Charged Up Season!
These are all the programming installs needed to start your journey in Robot Code Realm of FRC! https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VkrPgy_4gxf2-9ucWt5Y_Jn9ZSmfcKZ4GgSv4UyZqAA/edit

Here is the Google Drive providing all of the slides detailin what you need to know to program! https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BJZmdbPAMfXa3V8jKnI8-Gl7Op6I4b0U

In this Read Me are a few tidbits of information, useful to keep in mind while coding.

## Wonky Code
With the stress and rushed atmosphere while creating code during the season, everyone creates wonky or unclean code. This is an inevitable byproduct of the heat of the build season, but it's easier for changes down the line if you try to get our code as clean as possible. If you have extra time during the season, or even after build season is over, look back at your code to see if there are any improvements that could be made, so that other programmers can easily use your code as a starting point. Clean code makes development and improvement much easier.

## Comments
Another way to make sure your code is understood by other programmers is by commenting on your code. Commenting is very important so that all programmers can be on the same page when working on a project. Your commented code can be used as an example to help new programmers make a correlation with descriptions to syntax. Make sure you comment on your code!!!

## Branching
When adding more to the code, it's recommended that you create a new branch. The intention of your new branch should have a name to reflect it. You can create a new branch with: (replace <my-branch> with the name of your branch)
```
    git checkout -b <my-branch>
```
## Merging Finished Branches
Before merging your branch, you should run tests with it to make sure it is fully functional with no errors. Testing your changes on the robot is the best way to test your code. Then you can send a pull request to the main branch, and once everything is checked by the programming lead, they will approve the merge.

## Deploying Robot Code
Once the main branch is completed with no errors in it, you can deploy your robot code using the following steps:
```
    1. Power on the robot that you want to deploy the robot code to.
    2. Connect your computer's wifi to the robot's radio.
    3. Open up the main branch in the WPI version of VS Code.
    4. Use 'Control + Shift + P' inside VScode, and search for Deploy Robot Code.
    5. Click Deploy Robot Code
```
Now you can test your robot code on your robot.
